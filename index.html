<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The great intellectual defender and
educator of freedom/Capitalism Ludwig von Mises tells us:</span></p>

<p class=MsoQuote><span lang=EN-US>“It is ideas that group men into fighting
factions, that press the weapons into their hands, and that determine against whom
and for whom the weapons shall be used. It is they alone, and not arms, that,
in the last analysis, turn the scales.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none'><span lang=EN-US>We hope that in
addition to the moral indignation against Communism that fuels the passion to

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;border:none'><b><span
lang=EN-US>HOW CAPITALISM AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR WORKS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none'><span lang=EN-US>The differences between
economics systems comes down to who controls resources/property. In
Socialism/Communism resources are controlled by the ‘Central
Planners’/Experts/Government while in Capitalism it is private citizens. In
Capitalism, people’s ‘freedom to trade’ their ‘private property’ with anyone in
the entire planet inadvertently transforms mankind into a global supercomputer
where people/companies are motivated to innovate and learn from each other(competitors)
thus inadvertently cooperate to discover and spread superior information and
subsequent order. It is our freedom as consumers to buy the best cars, and as
producers to go into the auto manufacturing business, which motivates existing
auto manufacturers(competitors) to innovate/compete/learn to produce the best
cars lest they not get enough revenue/wealth with which to pay their employees
a <i>competitive wage</i> so they use their 'freedom to trade' their labor to
join the better-informed and thus more productive/efficient orders/companies. A
mind/CPU anywhere in the planet that comes up with an improvement will benefit
everyone in the world if they are 'free to trade' for his product/service which
will also motivate all competitors in the world to likewise improve their
actions/order. Just like in the Olympics we can discover the best athletes in
the world due to global competition, so does having the 'freedom to trade' with
everyone in the world allows the best ideas to compete/spread globally thus
ensuring the best possible global order. Via advertising, competitors are
motivated to spread the potential usefulness and superiority of their products/ideas
as well as the defects/inferiority of their competitors thus accelerating the
need to compete/copy/spread superior information. As cost-cutting ideas emerge
and inevitably spread via competition leading relative prices to continuously
fall, new profitable ideas easily arise and once again spread via competition
in an endless cycle of knowledge generation/innovation. For example, computers
were once very expensive, but once the price of making them came down enough,
people easily realized that every home could have them, which gave birth to our
computerized world and the Internet and all the great things that flow from it.
The more wealth is produced, the more wealth has to be offered in exchange for
labor as companies/orders compete against each other for the labor they need
which helps explain why the economic pie grows for everyone. For example,
imagine that after a shipwreck you end up in an island where everyone has a
machine that can turn dirt into food. Tom wants your labor to build a home, Mark,
to build a boat, and Gina to plant a garden. Competition will motivate them to
offer you all the food you want and more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none'><span lang=EN-US>Morals are ways of
acting, they too are knowledge which also emerges and spreads via economic
competition to considerable degrees. It is hard-working, tolerant, courteous
people who thanks to competition inevitably motivate everyone else to be
likewise. As Hayek tells us:</span></p>

<p class=MsoQuote><span lang=EN-US>“Competition is, after all, always a process
in which a small number makes it necessary for larger numbers to do what they
do not like, be it to work harder, to change habits, or to devote a degree of
attention, continuous application, or regularity to their work which without
competition would not be needed.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none'><span lang=EN-US>As millions of
Italians, Britons, Germans, Cubans and others from all over the world came to
America, it was ultimately the competition which grows from ‘private property’
and thus individual liberty/freedom which stripped these people of their
otherwise nationalistic/ethnocentric/tribalistic identities and evolved what
came to be seen as the classic American character/ethos of wanting to be seen
as a reputable/honest businessman/professional who treats everyone with respect
and wears a business suit as opposed to older religious/ethnocentric dress. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none'><span lang=EN-US>Thus freedom and emerging
<b>'competitive knowledge discovery'</b>, as opposed to leading to chaos, is
what enables and motivates the discovery and spread of superior information
which continuously increases the rate at which production takes place and civilizes
us. Till about the 1800s man’s mythology restricted his freedom via the
coercive/restrictive/monopoly plans of his master/King/Church/etc. but as it
was seen right/just that he should be free, the resulting <b>‘competitive
knowledge discovery’ </b>skyrocketed and so did production/innovation/prosperity
per graph below.</span></p>

people coming together/apart as companies/orders emerge and dissolve in
ever-changing conditions. Superior information arising and
rippling/restructuring the social order thanks to competition. As companies get
more productive they lure other people to ‘trade-with’/‘join-them’ by offering
more money/wealth for their labor, eventually causing the least productive companies/ideas
to dissolve as their ‘factors of production’ like labor, buildings, etc. are
bid away to be parts of more productive plans/ideas. A swarm intelligence
emerges as the freedom of consumers to calculate what is best nourishes the
growth and spread or superior orders/companies/information, inadvertently
expanding the worldwide “division of labor and information” as entire neighborhoods/cities
morph themselves in specialized ways as complementary pieces of
information/orders segregate themselves in distinct geographical locations like
the software industry in Silicon Valley, California and manufacturing in
Guangdong, southern China. As Mises reminds us “The division of labour is a
fundamental principle of all forms of life.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;border:none'><b><span
lang=EN-US>SOCIALISM/COMMUNISM AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none'><span lang=EN-US>The role of governments
should be to set the framework/laws that maximize such freedom/‘competitive
knowledge discovery’ and NOT to attempt to manage/order society because
governmental/‘public sector’ bureaucracies, being COERCIVE MONOPOLIES which get
their life/order-sustaining wealth through taxes/compulsion are immune to the
competitive-information-spreading incentives/pressures which motivate/force
private sector entities to keep up with the competition in terms of hustle, and
the copying and innovation of ideas. Government information is
monopolistic/competition-less information which is always bound to be inferior
to private/competitive information. Hayek:</span></p>

<p class=MsoQuote><span lang=EN-US>“The argument for liberty is not an argument
against organization, which is one of the most powerful tools human reason can
employ, but an argument against all exclusive, privileged, monopolistic
organization, against the use of coercion to prevent others from doing better.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none'><span lang=EN-US>Central/government
plans can’t work if people are free to not go along with them so they
inevitably require compulsion/tyranny. For example, it is a criminal act in
Communist countries like North Korea and most of Cuba to start a business, in
other words, to attempt a superior restructuring of society because it
interferes with the plans of “the experts” who run the government. It is also a
criminal act everywhere to not pay taxes that sustain public sector
bureaucracies like “public education” so there is little incentive or wealth to
sustain other, more desirable/superior competitors/ideas. For example, the NYC
public(monopolistic) school bureaucracy consumes about $29,000 per year to
“educate” a K-12 student. Refusing to pay a single dollar that goes to this
bureaucracy is a criminal act. Taxes and all transfers of wealth from the
private sector to the government, besides being an obvious coercive burden to
the people that had to sacrifice a part of their lives to earn such wealth and
now have less wealth to trade for the things they want, simply destroy the more
productive/efficient private sector jobs the taxed-away spending would have
sustained and replaces such productive/efficient and pie-increasing jobs for
inefficient government/monopoly ones, or worse, like militarism/wars. The
former Soviet Union had plenty of highly educated scientists/‘experts’ whose
plans required the coercion of millions as still happens in Cuba, but they were
thoroughly crushed by free Americans and their ‘competitive knowledge
discovery’. Socialist regimes and government in general also face an “incentive
problem.” In free societies, or the private sector, each person is incentivized
to be as productive and careful as possible and keep inefficiencies/risks to a
minimum since he owns/keeps the additional wealth or losses in terms of
unprofitable ideas or law suits. On the other hand, the government employee or
bureaucrat gets the same pay (ability to then consume) whether his department
did a good job (produced a lot) or not, and is also not risking his own wealth
since that comes from the taxpayers. In a free/Capitalist society a person is a
criminal only if he cheats on a contract or coercively interferes with other’s
property, while in a Communist/Socialist society he is a criminal if he does
not go along with the coercive/monopoly plans of the “experts” </span></p>

height=231 id="Picture 6" src="index_files/image003.jpg"
alt="Map&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none'><span lang=EN-US>A government regulation
is competition-less/monopoly information that is forced upon the entire social
order from the top-down via the law. In the free/private/competitive sector
information moves from the bottom (individual minds/entrepreneurs/innovators)
to the top/others/influencers as it is ‘tested’/refined/preferred/adapted by
the comparisons to other information by billions of minds thus ensuring
superior information spreads. This is bypassed by top-down regulation and all
government/monopoly action which ultimately comes at the expense of wiser
private action. The more the government regulates, the more it paralyzes
competitive knowledge discovery. As government regulations have increased in
the health care sector, turning it into a sort of island of paralyzed top-down
competition-less/socialist central planning, so have costs. These increased
costs have led the sector to grow from consuming just 4% of the American
economic pie in 1960 to over 20% in 2021. The “Science” is just information as
well, unfortunately medical science in most of the world is totally
regulated/paralized by government leading to spectacular failures/tyrannies.
Just like the above image and logic easily shows how coercive/monopoly
information leads to economic disaster, CovidMania lockdowns and coerced
vaccinations can easily be seen as Communism-like errors by comparing the
countries that did not lock down to those that did and paralyzed/destroyed
their economies/freedoms. Sweden and US states like Florida, and South Dakota
easily proved that all coercive/monopoly government action has been the
inevitable ineffective disaster that always occurs. Unfortunately, as with
Communism, the economic ignorance of the masses and resulting faith in coercive
monopoloy/“experts” still grips much of the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;border:none'><b><span
lang=EN-US>THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SOCIALISM/COMMUNISM</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none'><span lang=EN-US>Communism can’t
discover the needed information to order society in a manner that produces more
than it consumes so the economic pie continuously shrinks leading to eventual
famine/death. For example a restaurant in Miami sells picadillo for $8. Prices
in general and thus the $8 price provide vital information. Perhaps $1, might
be profit, and $7 will be spent in costs, in other words, in the necessary
consumption of wealth needed to produce the meal/wealth, things like the wealth
that had to be consumed/used to create equipment/electricity/food/supplies, and
everything employees and their families will consume at home (food, energy)
thanks to their paychecks that came from the $7/meal. The rising global
finance/banking industry, which motivates people with inferior ideas to consume
less than they produced and pairing such ‘saved wealth’ with
entrepreneurs(borrowers) who would then use it nourish the consumption of
workers as they increased the economic pie by an amount greater than prevailing
interest rates so they can pay back the loans to savers and still profit thus
giving a tremendous computational and productive boots to society, was seen as
some useless/malicious gimmick by the always “evil Capitalists”. Socialist
fools like Hitler even blamed Jews for it. Just like complex environmental
factors create selective pressures that favor the spread of certain genes, the
environment was ripe for the emergence of a new religion/mythology,
Socialism/Communism/'Coercive Competition-immune Central Planning by
Experts'/Statism. The businessman discovered two things that are IMPOSSIBLE for
a central planning body to discover regardless of the good intentions of its
members or their intelligence, 1) that there are enough customers nearby
willing to patronize the restaurant at the $8/meal price thus making their
lives better, and 2) <b><i>how</i></b> to reorder $7 worth of
stuff(labor/supplies/etc.) to profitably produce the meal. If he sets prices
too high, customers will choose other superior competing options. If he sets
prices too low, he won't be able to cover costs and will go out of business. In
other words, if he can't entice consumers to buy at a profitable price, the
entrepreneur is failing to reorder the world in a superior way as
judged/calculated by customers/CPUs. Therefore, Socialism/Communism can’t work
because only free people/businessmen dispersed throughout society are at the
right time and place needed to discover people’s desires(1) and (2) how to
properly set prices and thus create a profitable and competitive order ( i.e.,
one that produces more than it consumes while also providing a superior
alternative to customers/society). This helps us understand why Cuba had newer buildings
and cars and was more productive in 1958 than over 63 years later.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>For most of human evolution man has lived in small communal tribes
where things like money, finance/banking, the tradition of private property and
resulting ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ did not exist. Jealousy/hatred of
those that have more, especially in times of need, and the altruism that
motivates us to share are intuitive, while understanding the aforementioned
economic concepts is not and requires a tolerance and respect for private
property which goes against out tribalistic/communist instincts. As Hayek
explains:</span></p>

<p class=MsoQuote><span lang=EN-US>&quot;...man’s instincts...were not made for
the kinds of surroundings, and for the numbers, in which he now lives. They
were adapted to life in the small roving bands or troops in which the human

biological constitution of homo sapiens was being formed.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left;border:none'><span
lang=EN-US>The growing bewildering complexity of modern cities in 1800s led to
the viral spread of numerous economic fallacies. For example, competition and
advertising were seen as redundant and a way for selfish/greedy businessmen to
exploit and enrich themselves at the expense of workers, and monopoly control
by doogooder “experts” was seen as superior/fairer. Eventually someone would describe
these increasingly popular fallacies/myths in a manner that was bound to go
viral and that is what happened with Karl Marx and his bite-sized 'Communist
Manifesto':</span></p>
